/**
 * Google Consent Mode v2 Implementation
 *
 * This file will handle user consent for tracking cookies.
 * We'll implement this properly before adding any GTM tags.
 *
 * For now, this is a placeholder - we'll build this out when
 * we get to the Consent Mode chapter of learning GTM.
 *
 * Key concepts we'll implement:
 * - Default denied state (no tracking without consent)
 * - Consent banner UI
 * - Update consent based on user choice
 * - Store consent preferences in localStorage
 * - Integrate with Google Consent Mode API
 */

// Placeholder: Will be implemented when we reach Consent Mode in the learning path
console.log('Consent.js loaded - ready for Consent Mode v2 implementation');

/**
 * Future implementation will include:
 *
 * 1. setDefaultConsent() - Set initial denied state
 * 2. showConsentBanner() - Display consent UI to user
 * 3. updateConsent(granted) - Update consent based on user action
 * 4. loadConsentPreferences() - Check if user has previously consented
 * 5. gtag('consent', 'default', {...}) - Google's consent API
